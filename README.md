# SQL_table_creator
The main meaning of this code is to automatically create table in SQL from csv file.
For this task I've used Peewee library for python which helps us to create peewee table model.
In my code as example I use PostgreSQL connection but PeeWee and my model are universal, so You can change the data type settings,
depending on your needs.

My PeeWee model automatically creates table in SQL DB relying on
types of data in columns which you prefer.
